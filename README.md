# Taylor-Swift-Lyrics-Analysis

### Goals and Objectives

Taylor Swift is a household name, garnering fans from all over the world. For this project, I wanted to analyze her songs using different techniques like NLP to see if there was a relationship between song's characteristics and the song's popularity.

### Project Description

All the code was written in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.

To gather the data, I worked with 2 APIs, Spotify API, and Genius API. To properly retrieve the data in Python, I used the spotipy and lyricsgenius libraries. With this I was able to retrieve all of Taylor Swift's songs from her albums and had Spotify's analysis of each song with the lyrics of each song from Genius. Then I webscraped the artist page for Taylor Swift on Billboard 100 to retrieve the relevant information for all of her song's popularities.
